      <h2>What is a “now page”?</h2>
      <p>
        Most websites have a link that says “<strong>about</strong>”.
        It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person
        or business.
        For short, people just call it an “about page”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most websites have a link that says “<strong>contact</strong>”.
        It goes to a page that tells you how to contact this person or business.
        For short, people just call it a “contact page”.
      </p>
      <p>
        So a website with a link that says “<strong>now</strong>”
        goes to a page that tells you <strong>what this person is focused on at this
          point in their life.</strong>
        For short, we call it a “now page”.
      </p>
      <p>
        See examples by browsing <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it’s normal to make the web address “/now”, just like it’s usually
        “/about” and “/contact” in those other examples, the URL could be anything.
      </p>
      
      
  
      <h2>Why do I need a now page?</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re not already feeling that this would be very useful to you, then you
        don’t need one.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don’t already have your own website, with an “about” page that’s about
        you personally, then this isn’t for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t for marketing or attention.
        It will not benefit you in any business way.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s useful <strong>for the same reason an “about” page is useful on your
          site</strong>: because people on your site want to know more about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides answering the common question, “What are you up to these days?”, those
        who have a now page say it’s a good reminder of their priorities.
        By publicly showing what you are focused on now, it helps you say no to other
        requests.
