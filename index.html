        <h2>Middle and high schoolers, what can you make in 12 hours?</h2>
        <p>AngelHacks is a 12-hour hackathon. 100+ students from across LA will come for the weekend. You’ll team up (or go solo, if that’s what you prefer) to build an app, game, or website. We’ll provide free meals & drinks. In the evening, judges will pick the best projects to demo for everyone and win prizes. There'll be raffles and giveaways throughout the event as well! You’ll meet people, create amazing new things, & have fun.</p>

       <h3>Environment</h3>
        <p>Make something that helps the environment. It may seem like a hard thing, but remember, the small things count! Ship projects that count someone's carbon emissions, or tell you the truth about each state's pollution regulations. Be creative -- what does the environment mean to you? It doesn't have to be just the greenery, it could be how other people interact, or how the people around you behave.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p> A major goal of AngelHacks is to improve education—especially in computer science. Your project can help achieve this goal! Make a project that encourages students to make a mini-site, help teachers grade homework, create an online notes sharing pod, and more! We want you make a feasible project that can have a real impact on the community and beyond.</p>

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      <p>AI is an up and coming technology and everyone is hyped up about it. Create a chat bot, or a computer vision program, or something that utilizes machine learning to get special prizes! We'll also have a workshop on certain AI tools and languages, as well as mentors on hand to help you out!</p>
